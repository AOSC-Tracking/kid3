*** TO INSTALL

*** Linux

*** Compile for KDE

./configure # for SuSE use option --prefix=/opt/kde3
make
make install

To use precompiled headers (GCC 3.4):
./configure --enable-gcc-pch # for SuSE use option --prefix=/opt/kde3
# for Debian: ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-gcc-pch CC=/usr/bin/gcc-3.4 CXX=/usr/bin/g++-3.4
make pch
make
make install

*** Compile for Qt (no KDE)

./make_qtonly.sh

The install directory can be given as an optional parameter,
default is kid3qt.

*** Compile with Qt 4

The Makefiles have to be modified using

make qt4-Makefile

It is easier to use qmake with the Qt project file win32/kid3.pro:

qmake-qt4
make

*** Create Debian Package

Make sure that you have installed all packages listed in debian/control,
section Build-Depends.

dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -nc

*** Create RPM Package

Eventually change the prefix (/opt/kde3) and the configure arguments in
kid3.spec. They should work with SUSE. Copy kid3.spec into the SPEC directory
and the tar.gz archive into the SOURCES directory.

rpm -ba kid3.spec
 

*** Windows

*** Compile with non-commercial Qt version 3.2.1

If you want to use language files like kid3_de.qm for German
translations, generate them from KDE/Linux. They can be used for
example with "set LANG=de".

Qt must be installed and QTDIR set. The id3lib binaries and includes
must be installed.

nmake /f kid3.mak

To compile using Visual C++, use the files kid3.dsp, kid3.dsw or kid3.vcproj.

*** Compile with open source Qt version 4

qmake
mingw32-make
