*** TO INSTALL

*** Linux

*** Compile for KDE 3, Qt 3

make
make install

*** Compile for KDE2, Qt 2

The id3form.ui is not compatible with uic from Qt2, so you have to
generate the files in .ui/ with Qt3 and then generate the rest with Qt2:

make .ui/id3form.cpp
make QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt2 KDEDIR=/opt/kde2
make install

*** Compile for Qt 3 (no KDE)

Change line in config.mk to:
#CONFIG_USE_KDE=1

make
make install

The install directory can be set with the variable "prefix".

*** Compile for Qt 2 (no KDE)

Change line in config.mk to:
#CONFIG_USE_KDE=1

make .ui/id3form.cpp
make QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt2
make install

The install directory can be set with the variable "prefix".

*** Windows

*** Compile with non-commercial Qt version 2.3.0

.ui\id3form.cpp .ui\id3form.h must exist before compilation. They are
included in the distribution or can be generated using uic from Qt3/Linux.
If you want to use language files like kid3_de.qm for German
translations, generate them from KDE/Linux. They can be used for
example with "set LANG=de".

Qt must be installed and QTDIR set. The id3lib binaries and includes
must be installed.
Edit kid.mak so that ID3LIBDIR, ID3INCDIR point to the your id3lib
installation

Change line in config.mk to:
#CONFIG_USE_KDE=1

nmake /f kid3.mak
nmake /f kid3.mak install

The install directory can be set with the variable "prefix".
