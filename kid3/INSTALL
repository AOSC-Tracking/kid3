*** TO INSTALL

*** Linux

*** Compile for KDE

./configure
make
make install

*** Compile for Qt (no KDE)

./make_qtonly.sh

The install directory can be given as an optional parameter,
default is kid3qt.

*** Windows

*** Compile with non-commercial Qt version 2.3.0

If you want to use language files like kid3_de.qm for German
translations, generate them from KDE/Linux. They can be used for
example with "set LANG=de".

Qt must be installed and QTDIR set. The id3lib binaries and includes
must be installed.
Edit kid.mak so that ID3LIBDIR, ID3INCDIR point to the your id3lib
installation

nmake /f kid3.mak
nmake /f kid3.mak install

The install directory can be set with the variable "prefix".
